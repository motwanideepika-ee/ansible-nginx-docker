nginx-docker
==================

This role runs nginx container as a proxy for docker containers registered with
Consul. It uses consul-template to create nginx configs required to proxy 
traffic to the containers. Consul-template obtains service objects data 
registered on Consul for a given microservice/applicatoin and configures 
nginx docker container as a proxy for it.

In the context of service object as explained in [Registrator] documentation, 
note that each listening port is considered a service.

## Assumptions

This role assumes that 
- Docker Engine is installed locally
- service discovery backend is Consul
- services are registered on Consul using [Registrator]
- consul-template is installed and running as a service.  You may choose to 
  apply `wunzeco.consul-template` role to help with this but it is not enforced 
  as a dependency of this role to allow you the flexibility of installing
  consul-template by any means of your choosing.

So it may help to familiarise yourself with Registrator, consul and consul-template.


## Example

Run nginx docker container only

```
- hosts: myhost

  vars:
    nginx_docker_custom_log_fields: [ realip_remote_addr, http_x_customheader ] # if custom logging is required

  roles:
    - wunzeco.nginx-docker
```


Configure nginx as proxy to `services` exposed by a container.
e.g. jenkins docker container that listens on ports 8080 and 50000.

```
- hosts: myhost

  vars:
    nginx_docker_consul_host: "<consul_host_ip|fqdn>"
    nginx_docker_consul_port: 8500

  roles:
    - { role: wunzeco.nginx-docker,
        nginx_docker_container_name: jenkins,
        nginx_docker_container_port:   8080,
        nginx_docker_http_location_prefix: '/jenkins',
        nginx_docker_http_uri: '' }
    - { role: wunzeco.nginx-docker,
        nginx_docker_container_name: jenkins,
        nginx_docker_container_port: 50000,
        nginx_docker_http_location_prefix: '/jenkins-agent',
        nginx_docker_http_uri: '' }

```

Ensure that `nginx\_docker\_container\_port` and `nginx\_docker\_http\_location\_prefix`
pair are unique.

> **IMPORTANT to note:**
>
>    Registrator considers anything listening on a port a **service**. So if a
>    container listens on multiple ports, it has multiple services.
